Goals:
    
    -> Create a Median Filter Python code
    -> Create a BM3D Filter Python code
    -> Create functions for PSNR, SSIM
    -> (Optional) Add a timer to measure code execution time
    -> (Depending on Time) Make a .ipynb file, with all steps, making a detailed comparison

Dataset:
    
    -> Procure (upto) 10 High-Definition Images of varying subjects 
    (OR)     
    -> We can load MNSIT Dataset and use it as before
